# Xamarin.Forms Pattern
Coding patterns for developing Xamarin.Forms applications. This document was developed based on [eShopOnContainers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/tree/dev/src/Mobile) and [BethanysPieShopMobile](https://github.com/GillCleeren/BethanysPieShopMobile). The purpose of this project is to create a template for any Xamarin.Forms project. 

The project is basically a **MVVM** project with **Repository Pattern** implemented for local storage using **SQLite**. In the sample project there are also two test projects, one for **Unit Testing** and other for **UI Testing**. In the UI Testing project, I implemented the **Page Object Pattern**, according to Xamarin blogpost.
